  <h1>Writing complex regular expressions</h1>
  <time datetime=2011-04-15T20:48:00Z class="post-date">Fri, Apr 15, 2011</time>
  <p>
  Regular expressions are usually hard to read and understand. Even
  if you have a lot of experience in the subject chances are that
  when you revisit one of these that you wrote some time ago, it is
  very difficult to catch up.
</p>
<p>
  Several days ago, a very smart guy at work named Zolt√°n,
  recommended us to <strong>write complex regular expressions
  sepparating each logical part in a different
  line</strong>&nbsp;and also <strong>comment</strong> every single
  line.
</p>
<p>
  I did not know that this was possible at all, but he shown us how
  the modifier <strong>"x"</strong> (see it at the end of the
  following example) <strong>makes the compiler to ignore any
  whitespaces</strong> (spaces, tabs, line breaks) and even
  comments!!
</p>
<p>
  So, with this, you can write crazy regular expressions easy to
  parse and understand. Here there is a silly example, imagine it
  in a single line!:
</p>
<p>
  <em>(you better copy and paste this in your editor for
  readability)</em>
</p>
<pre>
if ( preg_match('/
    ^                  # Match the beginning
    (Can|May)\x20      # May is more formal but Can is also OK.
    [yY]ou\s           # Match space with "\ " or "\s"
    (please)?\x20      # "Please" is optional ;)
    (comment|doc)\x20  # Commenting = documenting
    this\ regexp\x20   # If UNICODE mode is on then
                       # you can match space with \x20
                       # (this is the modifier "u")
    to\s(know|see)\x20
    (what|WTF)\x20     # WTF = World Taekwondo Federation
    it\ does\?         # Note the "x" modificator below
    $                  # END of string
    /x',
    "Can you please comment this regexp to know what it does?" ) )
{
    echo "Thank you!";
}

</pre>
<p>
  Thank you Zoly!
