  This article explains how to setup the server and client to work
  with a remote working copy.
</p>
<p>
  To properly understand this post you should have read the
  previous post, <a href=  "http://www.harecoded.com/when-to-setup-remote-development-environment-over-sftp-working-copy-2139816">
  When to setup a remote development environment over SFTP (working
  copy)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To have the enviroment up and running you must setup once the
  server, and then apply the configuration of the client in every
  developer machine. But the client side is very simple and
  requires no installation at all.
</p>
<p>
  Here's how:
</p><h3>
  Server Side
</h3>
<p>
  These are the basic steps you need to do to get the server ready
  to create the remote working copy:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Create a catch-all DNS</strong>
</p>
<p>
  You should point a domain to the development machine. It is
  recommended to use a different one than the live DNS, or you can
  use a fake entry in the hosts file of the clients, but it's not
  very convenient. In this new domain you should configure a
  cath-all behavior (wildcard).
</p>
<p>
  As example, if your domain is awesomedevelopers.com than you
  should create a wildcard *.awesomedevelopers.com in your DNS
  panel so any request goes there.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Limit the access to the server</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The idea is to disallow any possible indexation to Google and do
  not let others see your page while you are working on it. Some
  methods you can use:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simple IP control through iptables or similar
  </li>
  <li>.htacces file or apache control
  </li>
  <li>&nbsp;header with www-authenticate
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Install all the services you are going to need in this
  machine.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  PHP, Mysql, Apache, Redis... anything that you might need must be
  installed in the server. A clone of the production machine is
  recommended. Avoids hearing in the future sentences like <em>"In
  my working copy worked like a charm"</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Configure the working copies</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Create the folders where the working copies go, for instance,
  this creates the working copies &nbsp;structure for the users
  named jta, api and alo.:
</p>
<pre>
mkdir -p /var/www/wc/{jta,api,alo}
</pre>
<p>
  Then create a user and password for each. Set desired permissions
  and clone the code at this stage if necessary (can be uploaded
  later):
</p>
<pre>
adduser jta<br>adduser api<br>adduser alo
</pre>
<pre>
passwd jta<br>passwd api<br>passwd alo
</pre>
<p>
  <strong>Modify the Virtual Hosts</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To make every working copy subdomain point to this folder.
  Example:
</p>
<pre>
<br>   ServerName <strong>alo</strong>.awesomedevelopers.com<br>   DocumentRoot "/var/www/wc/alo/htdocs"
<br>    ServerName <strong>api</strong>.awesomedevelopers.com<br>    DocumentRoot "/var/www/wc/api/htdocs"
<br>    ServerName <strong>jta</strong>.awesomedevelopers.com
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/wc/jta/htdocs"<br>
</pre>
<h3>
  Client Side
</h3>
<p>
  Then in the client, based on the cross-platform&nbsp;<a href=  "http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a> IDE the
  followint steps is all you have to do to start working with the
  working copy. It is pretty fast and does not involve working
  copies or service maintenance.
</p>
<p>
  All you have to do is create a new project, or reuse an existing
  one and then configure the editor to upload files automatically
  to the server.
</p>
<p>
  In detail...
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Configure the deployment settings</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The first thing to do is to configure the deployment server.
  PHPStorm needs to know where the machine is. To do so, go to:
</p>
<pre>
Tools &gt; Deployment &gt; Configuration
</pre>
<p>
  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/5023cb0061f4bs85951.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:"></a>
</p>
<p>
  Nothing special to say here, except that make sure to set
  correctly the root path which is the real path in the server. The
  user should have enough permissions to write in the server.
</p>
<p>
  Then go to the&nbsp;"Mappings" tab and add a couple of slashes if
  your web has no additional path needed in the URL:
</p>
<p>
  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/5023cb092797as65900.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:"></a>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Configure the deployment behaviour</strong>
</p>
<pre>
Tools &gt; Deployment &gt; Options
</pre>
<p>
  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/5023cb0367504s66967.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:"></a>
</p>
<p>
  Things you should take care of here are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Items you don't want to upload, such as the .git repo.
  </li>
  <li>The level of logging. I always set it to Details so I can see
  what the IDE is doing anytime in the File transfer window
  </li>
  <li>Overwrite files
  </li>
  <li>Create empty directories (if you usually work with git, this
  is something you already know how to handle)
  </li>
  <li>Automatic upload and external changes, are the 2 most
  important checkboxes. They make the IDE puts everything in the
  remote server as you work.
  </li>
  <li>Notify remote changes. This option will show a yellow bar
  asking you what to do if the file has changed in the remote
  server. Very convenient.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/5023cb06436b0s60359.jpg"><br></a>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Upload &nbsp;the code to the server</strong>
</p>
<p>
  For the first time. If the code is already in the server and you
  start fresh then do it the other way around, download it from the
  server. To upload:
</p>
<p>
  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/5023cafcbc093s78988.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:"></a>
</p>
<p>
  If the Menu "Deployment does not show up" then you need to go
  back to the deployment configuration and set the remote server as
  default (a small green tickbox in top of the server name)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tick automatic upload</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <img style=  "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title=""  src="/img/posts/5023cb06436b0s60359.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:">
</p>
<p>
  And now, PHPStorm will upload everything to the server. You don't
  need to save because PHPStorm does it automatically when the tab
  lose the focus (while you switch to the browser)
</p>
<p>
  Hope this seres of articles help :)
