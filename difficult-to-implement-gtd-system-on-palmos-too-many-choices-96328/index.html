  <h1>Difficult to implement a GTD system on PalmOS... too many choices!!!</h1>
  <time datetime=2007-02-06T00:00:00Z class="post-date">Tue, Feb 6, 2007</time>
  <p>These last days I am trying to be very serious about implementing GTD on my Treo 650. This is something that I have been wanting to do for quite some time, but I have been delaying as it demanded to sit for a while and start playing with different strategies to find a system that suits my needs and makes me comfortable with the organizational burden.</p>
<p>There are several applications on Palm devices that can help us with this GTD implementation: outliners (shadow plan, bonsai comes to mind), project managers (progect), wiki apps (note studio), time managers (Datebk), plain vanilla apps (Palm To Do, Calendar, Contacts), etc.</p>
<p>I always loved the memo concept and implementation on PalmOS devices, and it is something that has made me come back after a serious depart to Symbian some months ago. I am very fond with little snippets of plain text easily accessible via a global find, links from Datebk or wiki style thanks to pslink.</p>
<p>This is just the way I am managing right now my info: pslink and psmemo do the data mining, and Datebk6 is just wonderful for the hard landscape concept.  But this last week I couldn't resist to buy two other memo apps contenders: Memoleaf 5.1 and ABCTextPad. Both of them are very powerful and somehow complementary: Memoleaf is the most sofisticated on finding and managing keys and concepts. It also has a wonderful new alarm feature that avoids a lot of memo title duplication on Datebk6 just for the sake of alerting.</p>
<p>On the other side, ABCTextPad truly shines on text manipulation, it opens memos and txts without a hassle, offers two individual screens (you can find in one and paste in a memo on the other), it has screen keyboards, memo synchronization with texts, etc. etc.  So I was convinced (still I am) that in order to succeed in my GTD implementation I have to simplify and choose only one app for memo managing (Datebk6 has no rival for me on hard landscape managing)... I don't want to switch between Memoleaf and ABCTextPad all the time, but both of them are so powerful on complementary features...</p>
<p>Albeit both products have very good user guides, they have also a steep learning curve and I cannot afford to dedicate too much time on training.  Anyhow, they say choice is good, don't they?  Thanks for your time :-)</p>
