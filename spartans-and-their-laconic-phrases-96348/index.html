  <h1>Spartans and their laconic phrases</h1>
  <time datetime=2007-07-16T00:00:00Z class="post-date">Mon, Jul 16, 2007</time>
  <p>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laconic_phrase">Wikipedia</a>: A "<em>Laconic phrase</em>" is a very short or terse statement, named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta">Laconia</a>, an area of modern and ancient Greece. Laconians focused less on the development of education, arts, and literature.&nbsp;Some view this as having contributed to the Laconian characteristically blunt speech.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta">Spartans</a> were especially famous for their dry wit, which we now know as "<em>laconic humour</em>" after the region and its people. This can be contrasted with the "<em>Attic salt</em>" or "<em>Attic wit</em>", the refined, poignant, delicate humour of Sparta's rival Athens. In modern parlance, "<em>laconic</em>" is used to describe speech and writing which uses few words and is terse and concise.  One famous example comes from the time of the invasion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Macedon">Philip II</a> of Macedon. With key Greek city-states in submission, he turned his attention to Sparta and sent a message: "<strong>You are advised to submit without further delay, for if I bring my army into your land, I will destroy your farms, slay your people, and raze your city.</strong>" The Spartans sent back a one word reply: "<strong>If</strong>". Subsequently, both Philip and Alexander would avoid Sparta entirely.</p>
<p>I am reading lately a lot of Ancient History and I could not enjoy it more... As I'm taking three weeks of vacation and it seems I will have to cancel my trip to Denmark due to health problems on a close member of my family, I guess I'll end up August having read 3-4 more books on the subject.</p>
<p>I am focusing these days on the Greece 500-400BC period, a time where the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War">Peloponesian Wars</a> took place. I'm combining historical facts and fictional books. The last book I have read on the subject, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_fire">Gates of Fire</a> from Steven Pressfield is clearly a fictional one but very accurate with the facts, nonetheless. Pressfield writes about the famous last stand that 300 spartans and a thousand allies took against all the persian army at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae">Battle of Thermopylae</a>.</p>
<p><a title="Leonidas, the Spartan king" href="/img/posts/96348-83180.jpg" alt="96348-83180.jpg" width="88" height="128" /></a>As always, the book blows away the film, and so this case is no different (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_%28film%29">300</a>, a 2007 film based on the comic and directed by Zack Snyder, is all about aesthetics and has a stupid script to say the least). Words are stronger than a thousand images, and the novel describes perfectly how terrible this battle probably was.</p>
<div>Now I am reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War">History of the Peloponnesian War</a>, by the first historian of our time, <a href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides">Thucydides</a> the athenian. And the next one will probably be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tides_of_War">Tides of War</a>, from Steven Pressfield again.  Have a nice summer!</div>
