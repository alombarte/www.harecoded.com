  <h1>Engineering culture for an Internet company</h1>
  <time datetime=2014-12-11T19:52:00Z class="post-date">Thu, Dec 11, 2014</time>
  <p>
  <img style=  "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title=  "Castellers de Vilafranca" src=  "/img/posts/549326968eea8s484688.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:undefined">Hope you will bear with me improvising the
  definition of <em>engineering culture</em> as <strong>the ideas,
  attitudes, organization and behavior of the members of an
  engineering-driven company</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Each one of the Internet companies we work in have an engineering
  culture, <strong>regardless of the awareness of their
  members</strong> (and managers). That's because a company is an
  ecosystem that operates under a series of
  individually-disconnected and collectively-connected principles
  that when placed together over time they become ideas, attitudes
  and behaviors conforming an Engineering culture: the reality on
  which the company operates and organizes itself.
</p>
<p>
  The Engineering culture might contain either organizational stuff
  or technical choices. Some companies disclose these operational
  habits and culture and publicly share in awesome presentations
  their stories of success (and failure). These companies will try
  to <strong>hire only people that fits well</strong> in this
  strategy. Others simply aren't very aware of what is their
  underlying culture, but at the end of the day all companies have
  an engineering culture, a mix of what "the company" wants and the
  individual beliefs.
</p>
<p>
  The following lines describe <strong>an abstract engineering
  culture I believe in</strong>, the one that fits better with my
  style.
</p>
<p>
  It is very difficult (and would be very long) to write a recipe
  in detail but see this article more as a notepad with ideas than
  a detailed recipe. You cannot cook only by reading this.
</p>
<p>
  Also understand that <strong>this is not the definition of the
  engineering culture I currently work in or had</strong>, but my
  point of view.
</p>
<p>
  By sharing this I hope you give a thought about your own
  engineering culture and of course to see you contribute back with
  comments, opinions and any disagreements (so I can keep
  improving!)
</p>
<p>
  This document can evolve and transform over time, as we all do in
  our career. What today is very clear tomorrow can be object of
  discussion and even considered a bad practice, as it happens with
  refactoring.
</p>
<p>
  Let's go!
</p>
<h2>
  Reliable co-workers
</h2>
<p>
  And by reliable I don't mean the quality of the work they produce
  in the first place, but their personality:
  <strong>Self-responsibility, honesty, fairness,
  accountability</strong> as main drivers.
</p>
<p>
  You know you are in a reliable team when:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Autonomy, transparency, and trust in others are strongly
  rooted. Word is kept.
  </li>
  <li>Failure is used to learn, and <strong>blameless</strong>
  postmortems are a good way to improve.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      There is no finger pointing between members
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      No politics are used, no fear.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Wins and loses are always as a team
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Every one is individually responsible for creating as much
      value as possible.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Good judgment is applied instead of being lead by imposed
      rules.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <em>Do it!</em> is the slogan, no bullshit, no excuses.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Beautiful teams
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Teams don't go bigger than 8 people (Many theories related
      with team size exist, and also for social interaction as the
      150 <em>Dunbar Number</em>)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Do the meetings only with a few, share results in a document.
      Not everyone needs to attend a meeting when conclusions are
      shared clearly later.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Autonomous multidisciplinary team. Should be able to resolve
      anything related with the product.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don't split one product between different teams, but split it
      by usage/consumption of it). Less coordination is required.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Every family needs safety
</h2>
<p>
  <em>"Look ma', no hands!"</em>, is a bad pattern. No one should
  cross-fingers during the product iterations, you need
  predictability. Do not endanger your business and let things to
  their fate. There are several things you can do to minimize the
  number of things going wrong, some examples are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Invest on <strong>automated testing</strong>. Proper testing
      assures no harm will be made to the products in the next
      release and helps engineers to play safe and with certain
      guarantees.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Foster constructive <strong>code reviews</strong> between
      colleagues. Not only many bugs will arise but junior members
      will learn a lot by reviewing seniors code, and of course
      they will make incredible contributions too.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Live monitoring</strong> on the production site, not
      only systems and services but also metrics on key business
      indicators. <em>Have user sign-ins decreased? Is advertising
      showing properly? Are there any deviations in the incoming
      cash?...</em>. The engineers need to now nothing has been
      broken after their code is deployed, an dit has to be
      <strong>real time</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Whatever is in the <em>master branch</em> (or the approach
      you use) has to be safe to be published, anytime. In case
      your workflow requires someone "pushing the button" to deploy
      then <strong>anyone should be able to</strong>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If your product is critical you might want a
      pre-production/integration/staging environment to take a
      moment of safety before going live, although IMHO it is
      always better to have continuous deployment and put small
      pieces in production without stopping and accumulating
      changes in these environments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Never, ever have code generation on-the-fly</strong>
      on deployment time. Do not put anything in production that
      can't be tested in an earlier scenario.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Incremental development
</h2>
<p>
  Grouping tons of features and releasing all of them at once is a
  bad idea. Anything can go wild and then you need to <em>run like
  a headless chicken</em> (that's a literal translation of a set
  phrase in spanish, but very graphical). You'll never know what
  piece of all the code you put online altered the metrics and
  fixing anything can be hard. Instead of releasing
  functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Publishing small pieces of code, constantly and frequently
  will help you detect failure faster.
  </li>
  <li>If these pieces are part of a greater thing that cannot be
  seen by the end user yet, hide it. Use <strong>configuration
  flags</strong> or use inaccessible pages to toggle features. Even
  the code is not "seen" this might help you find out system
  instabilities and detect problems prematurely. Reverting is very
  easy when you have toggling flags.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use a <strong>continuous integration</strong> infrastructure
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The development to production cycle has to take only a few
      minutes. When the developer has finished a working piece of
      code should be eligible for going live in few minutes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Use continuous deployment whenever is possible
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Reverting code can be done moving formward instead of
  backwards. Just commit the reverted changes, this is something
  natural in any DVCS.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Open source mindset
</h2>
<p>
  Even if you don't want to share any of your code with the world,
  the open source community has very good habits you might adopt.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Everyone is free to contribute in any piece of code and all
      the code is opened to invite anyone to participate.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If someone wants to change code a pull request to the owner
      is made, just like in any open source project. Note that you
      need an owner (person or team) of everything you produce.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Whatever you touch, you leave it better than it was.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Anything not related with the core business should be
      eligible for going open source, for real.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Inside the company you don't change "others" code. It's
      yours. Any piece of code in the company is YOUR code.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      So say "NO" if it will harm the code
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don't write crappy code
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      But at the same time balance technology with product
      delivery.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Have a culture of one team
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Managers are not above engineers
</h2>
<p>
  Becoming a manager is not a step up in your career but a change
  in the orientation of your work. Managers facilitate process and
  help people, engineers solve technical problems. Apply for
  management if you are more motivated towards helping people.
  Related to that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Pay scales between managers and engineers should be equal.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Managers of engineers must have been engineers at some point
      to better understand the problems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Managers measure team happiness, just as another metric.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      A manager explains the problem, the teams will think on
      solutions. As a manager, do not tell the team what and how to
      do it, give your opinion for sure but don't lead the
      solution.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Managers are to remind the mission and explain and define the
      strategy.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Flexibility is important and engineers will help make the
  strategy better.
  </li>
  <li>Default the company to information sharing. Everything should
  be shared unless there's a strong reason not to.
  </li>
  <li>Implement team chat rooms, bots and integration
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Grow and help others
</h2>
<p>
  Being focused on the day to day and the products won't make you
  grow and won't cultivate you without an addition.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Foster the innovation</strong>. Make a hackathon
      every quarter, lasting 24h.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Most people will welcome a family &amp; friends day once in a
      while.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Celebrate</strong> culture rockstars. People who fits
      in the engineering culture has to be recognized.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Celebrate wins. You don't need to make a party, celebration
  comes in many forms including a simple <em>High five</em>!.
  Praise people.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Internal training is very important. All members should give
      speeches and workshops so everyone learns something new.
      Exchange knowledge between different teams.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Helping others is your first responsibility</strong>.
      Do not leave colleagues in the cold. When you are in trouble
      ask for help responsibly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Switch team members between teams if they are more interested
      and will bring more value.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Help people in other teams that are interested in other areas
      of specialization and can contribute in the same are you are
      a specialist.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Afterwords
</h2>
<p>
  I tried to cover some topics relevant in the operation of an
  organization, but of course there are many things I didn't write
  and left out the document. I will be very happy to hear your
  thoughts.
