  <h1>When to setup a remote development environment over SFTP (working copy)</h1>
  <time datetime=2012-08-08T17:49:00Z class="post-date">Wed, Aug 8, 2012</time>
  <p>
  When a programmer has a local copy of the code and an environment
  fully functional where the web can be tested before going live,
  we usually call it a&nbsp;<strong>working copy</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The action of moving/copying/putting this work in the final live
  server (a.k.a <em>production server/environment</em>) is called
  the&nbsp;<strong>deploy</strong>&nbsp;action.
</p>
<p>
  There are many ways of having a working copy up and running. We,
  the key stroker maniacs, use to work more or less with one of the
  following <strong>working copy configurations</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>No working copy</strong>. The one who enters via SSH
    and uses the editor <a href=    "http://www.vim.org"><strong>vi</strong></a>. Yeah!
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Edit via FTP/SFTP</strong> with an editor installed in
    the local machine.&nbsp;No working copy,&nbsp;<em>the
    return</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Local web server</strong>. Usually a
    pre-built&nbsp;<abbr title=    "Linux Apache Mysql PHP">LAMP</abbr>&nbsp;solution, such
    as&nbsp;<a href=    "http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>.
    Valid until you need to add 2 or 3 more services like
    Memcached, Sphinx, Solr, MongoDB, Redis or anything like that,
    or the Virtual host configuration starts to change over and
    over.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>A web server in your LAN.</strong> Several users using
    a machine with all the services configured, having their own
    running copy. Different DocumentRoot per user.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>Virtual machine</strong> lover, who runs a
  <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>&nbsp;or
  <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare</a> with a full linux
  installed and exports and shares the appliance with colleagues if
  necessary.
  </li>
  <li>The <a href=  "http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>&nbsp;<em>chef</em>, who has an
  automated system to deliver pre-configured environments to any
  number of developers using VirtualBoxes underneath.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In this post, I am proposing something different, it has the
  smell and <em>aroma</em> of&nbsp;the early 90's development, but
  still, a good solution when you have a middle team (2-20) where
  people don't want to be bothered with constant database changes
  and service tunning. It is the private&nbsp;<strong>remote
  working copy over SFTP</strong>. Keep reading...
</p><h3>
  The concept of private remote working copy
</h3>
<p>
  The <strong>remote working copy,</strong> or the <strong>remote
  development environment</strong> is what I call a development
  server <strong>available on the Internet</strong>. It is very
  useful if <strong>you have no offices</strong> and people from
  different places in the world need to access and work against a
  running server, meaning that no local configuration or
  installation is needed by end developers.
</p>
<p>
  Of course there are other ways to address this problem, but this
  is one I like pretty much without involving Vagrant, Virtual
  Machines and other similar solutions (I have a 4 year-old machine
  that works like a charm, but is not very good at RAM, and VMs eat
  that for breakfast).
</p>
<p>
  I call it <strong>private</strong> not because has sensitive data
  but because it should be invisible to Google (mainly) so it's not
  indexed in order to avoid any duplication/competence with your
  real live web app. You can accomplish this via a simple firewall
  configuration allowing only certain IPs, for instance:
</p>
<pre>
# Accepts connections only from 80.24.22.70 to 80.24.22.80
iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -m iprange --src-range 80.24.22.70-80 -j ACCEPT
</pre>
<div>
  More simple, a basic HTTP password challenge implementation in
  your PHP code, request with this line:
</div>
<pre>
header( 'WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Protected page"' );
</pre>
<p>
  And for people on <strong>shared hostings, the easier would be to
  place an .htaccess file</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This server is ment to be hacked, destroyed and broken several
  times a day if necessary. Yes, because is a working copy for
  development purposes only, and that's what we programmers do with
  the webs, destroy them all the time. And we like it.
</p>
<h3>
  Developer Workflow
</h3>
<p>
  The workflow is quite simple, but don't judge it too fast:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have a copy of the code in your local machine (git, svn,
  hg, whatever you use). That's it, no web services or related are
  installed.
  </li>
  <li>You work with a capable editor which will send all your
  changes to the remote server over SFTP (I strongly recommend
  <a href=  "http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download">PHPStorm</a>, it's
  worth every penny )
  </li>
  <li>You test your work in a real URL, which should be unrelated
  to the real project. Buying a dummy domain might be a very good
  option.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Ingredients
</h3>
<p>
  You'll need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A dedicated server
  </li>
  <li>A different domain, but public
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href=    "http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download">PHPStorm</a>. I
    don't recommend other solutions, they fail to work.&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li>Clone the production server in the development machine. All
  services.
  </li>
  <li>A folder structure that holds every developer.
  </li>
  <li>Virtualhosts for every user
  </li>
  <li>Subdomains (a catch-all should be configured) for every
  developer
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
  An example: If your team has 4 developers, with the initials
  <em>alo</em>, <em>sam</em>, <em>api</em>, <em>aga</em> then you
  should create domains like:
</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>alo.my-devel-project.com
    </li>
    <li>sam.my-devel-project.com
    </li>
    <li>api.my-devel-project.com
    </li>
    <li>aga.my-devel-project.com
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div>
    And folders with full working projects like:
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>/var/www/wc/alo/htdocs
      </li>
      <li>/var/www/wc/sam/htdocs
      </li>
      <li>/var/www/wc/api/htdocs
      </li>
      <li>/var/www/wc/aga/htdocs
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<h3>
  Pros
</h3>
<div>
  This system is lovely if:
</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>You work with more people
    </li>
    <li>You want to keep all the colleagues with the architecture
    in-sync. You like to do alter tables, apply changes to services
    constantly and don't want to tell the others <em>"hey! do this
    ALTER in your environment"</em> or, "<em>I just changed the
    search index configuration, here's new"</em>.
    </li>
    <li>There is people in the team who is skilled in everything
    else but in systems engineering or&nbsp;<a href=    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a>
    </li>
    <li>You use different machines or you set-up the environments a
    lot.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<h3>
  Cons
</h3>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>It might be slow</strong>&nbsp;if you have a rural
      Internet connection under 512kbps. But connections nowadays
      are very fast. Uploading 100Kb files (a lot of code there) is
      done while you switch from the editor to the browser.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>One-way by default.</strong> Although clients like
      PHPStorm will warn you if a file is has changed in the remote
      server with a link to download or merge, this system is not
      very good if you need to generate a lot of files in the
      webserver, because you would need &nbsp;to remember to
      trigger a synchronization action to download them to your
      machine and then add them to version control system.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
