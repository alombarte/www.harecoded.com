      <description>It might seem very obvious to you that if you migrate from Posterous&amp;nbsp;blogs to another service your images should be transitioned as well.  If you want a free service (as Posterous was) there are only two options where you can migrate your Posterous to without writing all your posts one by one&amp;nbsp;again:  1)&amp;nbsp;Wordpress.com (but losing all the images)
2)&amp;nbsp;Obolog.com (and keeping all the images)  So, if you want your blog back including images the only option you have is Obolog.</description>
