      <description>If you want to merge branches in your projects using a Mac OS X, you&#39;ll probably miss how straightforward is to do that with the TortoiseSVN client.
Mac has many SVN-fashioned clients where you can fall in love when you see the GUI, but when it comes to do a merge it seems that all they have forgotten to include support for it. I haven&#39;t seen any free or comercial application for Mac that integrates all the subversion commands in the same tool without pain.</description>
