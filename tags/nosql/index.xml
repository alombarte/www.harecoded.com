      <description>I do store a lot of statistical data in Redis, storing information on what users do and behave every day, week, month and so on... But storing a huge amount of data in memory has a little drawback: memory is cheap and fast, but is finite.  From time to time (e.g: cron job) I need to clean up the house because there is too much memory filled that is no longer interesting to keep it.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve been playing recently with several distributed databases with the aim of choosing the best solution for my needs. Since there isn&#39;t much documentation on the web with a general overview on the subject, I write here some comments, thoughts and my humble experience. Hope it&#39;s usefull for you, this document is not a comparison of performance, or a &#34;mine is bigger than yours&#34;,&amp;nbsp; just some ideas ;)
