      <description>Hope you will bear with me improvising the definition of engineering culture as the ideas, attitudes, organization and behavior of the members of an engineering-driven company.  Each one of the Internet companies we work in have an engineering culture, regardless of the awareness of their members (and managers). That&#39;s because a company is an ecosystem that operates under a series of individually-disconnected and collectively-connected principles that when placed together over time they become ideas, attitudes and behaviors conforming an Engineering culture: the reality on which the company operates and organizes itself.</description>
