      <description>If you are looking for Varnish&amp;nbsp;syntax highlighting for PHPStorm, as per today, you won&#39;t find a plugin. This post is not publishing a plugin for proper vcl syntax highlighting but a quick hack to see some coloring.  Given the fact&amp;nbsp;Varnish configuration files are very similar to C I tried to associate the .vlc type to C files. &amp;nbsp;It is not rocket science but at least your eyes will hurt less.</description>

      <description>PHPStorm 6 bundles a new feature called &#34;File watchers&#34; which enables Sass, LESS, SCSS, CoffeeScript, TypeScript transpilation. This option will compile your compass/scss/whatever files when the source file is saved (this is when you lose the focus or manually save).  So, for the basic stuff you can stop using external programs and watchers likeCodeKit or LESS.app&amp;nbsp;now. But of course unexpensive software like CodeKit is a must have if you are a frontend developer.</description>
