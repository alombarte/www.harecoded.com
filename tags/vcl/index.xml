      <description>In a web server you can use directives to deny the unwanted eye to look at your content. This is an example of how Apache would handle a virtual host that only accepts connections from a series of IPs, but in Varnish that won&#39;t work.  Order Deny,Allow Deny from all # Barcelona IPs Allow from 89.140.xxx.xxx/27 # Japan IP Allow from 222.229.xxx.xxx/32   The reason that this won&#39;t work in Varnish is because the IP Apache is receiving is 127.</description>
