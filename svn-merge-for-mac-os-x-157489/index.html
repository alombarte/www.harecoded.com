  <h1>SVN merge for Mac OS X</h1>
  <time datetime=2009-02-11T06:30:00Z class="post-date">Wed, Feb 11, 2009</time>
  <p>If you want to <strong>merge branches </strong>in your projects using a Mac OS X, you'll probably miss how straightforward is to do that with the <strong>TortoiseSVN </strong>client.</p>
<p>Mac has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">many</span> SVN-fashioned clients where you can fall in love when you see the GUI, but when it comes to do a merge it seems that all they have forgotten to include support for it. I haven't seen any free <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">or comercial</span> application for Mac that integrates all the subversion commands in the same tool without pain. You need always a couple of tools and sometimes use the terminal commands (I do this the most in Mac).</p>
<p>Returning to the specific <strong>svn command merge</strong>, here are the only tools that you can use to accomplish that task:</p>
<h3>Subcommander:</h3>
<p>Graphical subversion client with diff and merge tool. <a href="http://subcommander.tigris.org/">http://subcommander.tigris.org/</a></p>
<h3>DiffMerge</h3>
<p>Multiplatform utility for merging and comparing: <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/">http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/</a> (not SVN specific)</p>
<h3>Guiffy:</h3>
<p>Guiffy is a normal diff/merge application, you don't need to use Subversion, but it comes with support for CVS/SVN. <a href="http://www.guiffy.com/"> http://www.guiffy.com/</a></p>
<p>And that's all. I've spent many hours looking for more apps, but I haven't found any helping me with the merge integrated with SVN. If you find anything let me know and I'll add it to the list.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE (Added SmartSVN)<br /></strong></p>
<h3>SmartSVN (commercial)</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartsvn/">SmartSVN </a>is the most complete solution for Mac I've seen. It runs on Windows and Linux as well. Although it is not a Cocoa application and doesn't accept things like drag and drop it does everything you might need, and speaking about merge:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Merge from 2 sources</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reintegrate branches</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The application allows to create several projects, browse them (very clean and neat), see the logs inside the context, see diffs, resolve conflicts, tags, branches, logs, filters... everything!!!</p>
<p>I don't understand how this application isn't more popular, since is the missing app for advanced mac developers and works on any platform.</p>
<p>If you find anything interesting please let me know and I'll add it in the list.</p>
