<p>I have been searching for a good rss reader since <a href="http://www.harecoded.com/2007/06/09/why-i-changed-my-brand-new-nokia-n800-for-a-770-and-something-more/">I switched my Nokia N800 for a Nokia 770</a>, as the latter doesn't come with a default application for handling news feeds. And since I had already found a truly perfect <a href="http://mike.yi.org/projects/quiver/wiki/QuiverForMaemo">image viewer</a>, this became the last software I needed to complete what was a fantastic mobile computer by the way.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, to the point that I stopped using <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/">Netnewswire</a>, one of the best Mac OSX apps in my opinion. Being able to use the same interface regardless of the computer you may be using at any given time is a winner feature for me, and that's also the reason I wasn't very fond on the Nokia N800 reader, despite the nice software it really is.</p>
<p>But Google Reader doesn't behave very well on the Nokia 770, not well at all... No problem, someone in a forum pointed me to a better solution: <a href="http://readermini.com">http://readermini.com</a>, which is Google Reader with a simpler interface!</p>
<p>Really, it is a web service where you login with your Google Reader account and it opens up your feed suscriptions, with a lighter web 2.0 experience but not loosing any of the functionalities you are used to.  I won't try to explain for 20 more lines how well <a href="http://readermini.com">readermini.com</a> behaves... just try yourself! And besides, someone has worked out a great video demonstration which is published everywhere, so here it is another instance of it :-)</p>

<p><a href="http://readermini.com">readermini.com</a> has definetly found a home in my Nokia 770, but will it be able to replace Google Reader on my desktop computer? I think so, at least I will try it for a week and tell you about it.</p>
