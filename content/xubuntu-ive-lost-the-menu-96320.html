<p><strong>Don't panic!</strong></p>
<p>It seems to be common to lose the right-button menu when you open the menu editor (I had a 'Segment violation' error). To recover it, open a terminal, and type:</p>
<p><code> cp /etc/xdg/xfce4/desktop/menu.xml ~/.config/xfce4/desktop/menu.xml</code></p>
<p><code></code>That's all. If you have problems because the directory doesn't exist, create it first:</p>
<p><code>mkdir ~/.config/xfce4/desktop </code></p>
