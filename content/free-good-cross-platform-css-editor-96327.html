<p>There are many applications where you can edit your Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in Linux, Windows or Mac, but specifically in my Ubuntu I haven't found an application like <a title="Cssed home page" href="http://cssed.sourceforge.net/">CSSED</a> (GTK). It supports auto-completion, really useful wizards, color pickers, preview and a long etcetera. You can go directly to the <a title="Download page for Mac OS X, Windows, Linux" href="http://cssed.sourceforge.net/download.php">download page</a> and see specific instructions for Gentoo, BSD, Mac OS X (via Fink), Windows ... or if you are an ubuntu or debian user just type in a terminal (or through the synaptic manager):</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>sudo apt-get install cssed</strong></li>
</ul>
