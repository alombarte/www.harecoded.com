  <img title="" src=  "/img/posts/51361d7c353c9s4182.jpg" alt=  " TAGS:" align="left">This is a simple script that
  <strong>duplicates your entire database</strong>. There are many
  ways in which you can take advantage of having an exact replica
  of your production database.
</p>
<p>
  In short, the behaviour of the script is the following (in this
  order, all piped):
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Delete the COPY database if possible to start with a fresh
  one
  </li>
  <li>Create the COPY database
  </li>
  <li>Dump the PRODUCTION database
  </li>
  <li>Inject the output of the dump into the COPY database
  </li>
</ol><p>
  Any errors during the process will be logged to the file defined
  as $ERROR. Be aware that the user you you choose to connect to
  mysql needs CREATE and DROP database permissions. Note that there
  are some --force parameters. That will make the script continue
  even if something fails. The first time you launch the script
  you'll see that cannot drop the copy database.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Copy &amp; paste the following into a new file
  ~/duplicate_database.sh, and modify the credentials:
</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# Albert Lombarte
# Docs: http://www.harecoded.com/copycloneduplicate-mysql-database-script-2184438

PRODUCTION_DB=myapp
# The following database will be DELETED first:
COPY_DB=myapp_copy
USER=root
PASS="yourP4ssw0rd"
ERROR=/tmp/duplicate_mysql_error.log
echo "Droping '$COPY_DB' and generating it from '$PRODUCTION_DB' dump"
mysql -u$USER -p$PASS -e "drop database $COPY_DB;" --force &amp;&amp; mysql -u$USER -p$PASS -e "create database $COPY_DB;" &amp;&amp; mysqldump --force --log-error=$ERROR -u$USER -p$PASS $PRODUCTION_DB | mysql -u$USER -p$PASS $COPY_DB
</pre>
<p>
  And launch it:
</p>
<pre>
bash ~/duplicate_database.sh
</pre>
<p>
  If you want to do it on a daily basis, you can add it in your
  crontab. Type <code>crontab -e</code> and write something like
  this:
</p>
<pre>
# At 7am clone the production database
7 0 * * * bash /home/myusername/duplicate_database.sh
</pre>
<p>
  If you want to make this copy in another host you have to add the
  SSH connection with <code>ssh -C "command"</code> in the first
  and last <code>mysql</code>commands
</p>
<p>
  Like:
</p>
<pre>
ssh -C user@remotehost "mysql -u root -p -e 'create database ...... | ssh -C user@remotehost "mysql -u"
</pre>
