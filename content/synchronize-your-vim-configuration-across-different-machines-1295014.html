<p>If you are a Vim user, chances are that you also work with several machines, and you spread the same configuration over them.</p>
<p>I do share my vim configurations between <strong>Windows, Mac and Linux</strong> and store the same configuration for all the environments in my <strong>Dropbox folder</strong>. The idea is to have a central place where I can manage all my Vim installations, and then link it. Easy as that.</p>
<p>I <strong>synchronize .vimrc and .vim using Dropbox</strong>, but many other forms are possible, such as <a title="Ubuntu One cloud" href="https://one.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntuone</a>, <a title="Another Dropbox like service, but with more free storage" href="https://www.sugarsync.com/">Sugarsync</a> or any other cloud service you might have. And even a GIT/SVN/Mercurial/whatever repository based storage that you update from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>How it works?</strong></p>
<p>Put all your <strong>vimrc</strong> and <strong>vimfiles</strong> in a centralized place. I use:</p>
<pre>~/Dropbbox/DotFiles/vimrc [the plain text configuration file]
~/Dropbbox/DotFiles/vimfiles [the directory]
</pre>
<p>Then in every machine, I have the ~/.vimrc (_vimrc in windows' gvim) with a single line, referencing the configuration stored in the dropbox folder. I could directly link the file, but sometimes you may want to add a couple more of lines specific to a machine. The content of the <code>~/.vimrc</code> file is just:</p>
<pre>source ~/Dropbbox/DotFiles/vimrc<br /># Additional stuff specific to the machine here...</pre>
<p>This will include the vimrc stored in my Dropbox folder. Finally, I just create a symbolic link to the <code>vimfiles</code> folder:</p>
<pre>ln -s &nbsp;~/Dropbbox/DotFiles/vimfiles ~/.vim</pre>
<p>Now, apply this steps to all machines you have, and whenever you change your <code>.vimrc</code> or install a new plugin will be available to all your installations.</p>
