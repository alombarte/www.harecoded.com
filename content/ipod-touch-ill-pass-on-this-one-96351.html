<p>Last week I sold my 30Gb ipod video for a bargain prize, just anticipating the shinny acquisition of a new generation ipod. I was never very happy with the ipod video anyways, being the main gripe its short battery life, which could only handle 2 hours of video playback and no more than 10 hours of music. I was never able to abstract from this issue, always observing the battery meter on the screen.</p>

<p>I came to the ipod video from an ipod 2G, and that was such a trusty player! But the 20gb version was also bulky as hell and I was never using it on the go. I wanted portability, and I wanted video. Just the same old gadget compromises story :-)  Sooo, I just sold my ipod video, an omiz bluetooth portable keyboard and a Palm Tungsten T3, and gathered enough money to buy a new hyper powerful media player.  My first option was an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">Ipod Touch</a>, based on this considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would love to enjoy this new multitouch interface, as the iPhone is not still Barcelona friendly.</li>
<li>The form factor is extremely attractive, what a slim and elegant device it is!</li>
<li>The big screen is a plus, maybe it could substitute my trusty Nokia 770 tablet for watching videos.</li>
<li>Safari optimized for a portable device, this may deliver a sweet web browsing experience from the sofa (just as it does now the Nokia 770, anyway).</li>
<li>Cover flow and the pictures app may be for sure a pleasure to put the fingers upon.</li>
<li>There is a huge community outside Apple with the aim and knowledge to exploit this device as a pda.</li>
<li>And, well, it also works as a music player.</li>
</ul>
<p>As clear as it was my decision, I changed it when I read there were some ipod touch issues arising from the first hands on and reviews of the product:</p>
<ul>
<li>TFT poor quality, awful black color contrast that ruins the video experience.</li>
<li>Slower than it should synchronization with iTunes: while it takes 8 minutes to copy an 8Gb iTunes collection to the new ipod nano, the same action lasts 17 minutes on the ipod touch (ouch!)</li>
<li>Battery seems to last a couple hours less than advertised (I have been there, didn't like it).</li>
<li>While the new ipod nano appears to me as a logical evolution of the line, the touch on the contrary is more of an involution of the iPhone, just for the sake of not bringing competence to the successful mobile: the ipod touch comes with no e-mail client, sans bluetooth, cannot add events to the calendar, it has no notes application, no volume buttons...</li>
</ul>
<p>So finally I'll pass on this ipod touch first edition, at least until the situation of the screen and software gets better... But I know I will jump onboard as soon as the 2nd generation or the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/09/26/up_next_for_apple_the_return_of_the_newton.html">rumored iNewton</a> appear at the Apple stores in some months to come.    Besides, I am by now the proud owner of an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">ipod nano</a> 8Gb black edition, and what a beauty and complete device it is!</p>
