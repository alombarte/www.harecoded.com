  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/53cfb593e182es64351.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:undefined" align="right"></a>If you are looking for
  <strong>Varnish&nbsp;syntax highlighting</strong> for PHPStorm,
  as per today, you won't find a plugin. This post <strong>is
  not</strong> publishing a plugin for proper <strong>vcl syntax
  highlighting</strong> but a quick hack to see some coloring.
</p>
<p>
  Given the fact&nbsp;Varnish configuration files are very similar
  to C I tried to associate the .vlc type to C files. &nbsp;It is
  not rocket science but at least your eyes will hurt less. If you
  want proper coloring then use the <a href=  "https://github.com/pld-linux/vim-syntax-vcl">vim plugin for
  Varnish</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In order to give it a try go to <em>Settings -&gt; File
  Types</em> and then add the *.vcl extension in the C type.
</p>
<p>
  You can also try some other weirdo stuff, like SASS syntax. If
  you find anything better inside PHPStorm please let us know.
