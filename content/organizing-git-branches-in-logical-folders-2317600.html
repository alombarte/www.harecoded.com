  It is easier to find things when they are well organized. If you
  are a git user a good practice to name the branches would be to
  use descriptive names including slashes "/" (as in paths) where
  everything before the slash is the folder you want to use and
  then the logical name after it.

<p>
  If you use the fantastic git graphical interface SourceTree (free
  for Windows and Mac) then you will be able to navigate these
  branches using folders.
</p>
<p>
  Of course if you use advanced tools like the git-flow extensions
  (strongly recommended in large environments) this kind of
  behaviour is automatically managed.

  <strong>An example:</strong>

<p>
  Let's say we usually work in branches when we want to release new
  features. This is a screenshot on how it would look like creating
  the following branches in SourceTree:
</p>
<pre>
git checkout -b feature/editor<br>git checkout -b feature/reset-email<br>git checkout -b devel
</pre>
