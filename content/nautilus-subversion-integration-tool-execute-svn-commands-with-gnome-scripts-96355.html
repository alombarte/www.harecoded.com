<p>
  I have been using subversion (svn) for years from the command
  line... But some months ago I changed my job and I started using
  windows environments. And I must admit TortoiseSVN is the best
  GUI SVN client i've seen ever before. While my needs are
  satisfied in Windows with <a href=  "http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> and in Mac OS X
  with <a href="http://scplugin.tigris.org/">SCPlugin</a> and
  <a href=  "http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/features/">
  SvnX</a>, I was lacking a subversion tool to manage my files
  while exploring files in my Ubuntu (nautilus file explorer).
  That's why i decided to create my own set of scripts to integrate
  them on Nautilus contextual menu for a quick access without
  opening SVN programs or shell. I took the icons from the <a href=  "http://pysvn.tigris.org/">SVN Workbench</a> since that is the
  client that I mostly use in Ubuntu and my eye finds the actions
  faster.

I created these scripts&nbsp; in 2007. You'd rather&nbsp; <strong>

  read this article about TortoiseSVN for Linux</a></strong> before
  setting any of the following scripts if you want a poslished
  package without manual tuning.

  The following actions are supported by now:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>svn status
  </li>
  <li>svn update
  </li>
  <li>svn add
  </li>
  <li>svn commit
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  It takes no more than 5 minutes to implement, for example, the
  svn checkout. I leave it to you. I post this quickly because
  there is people around willing to test it. This is not tested
  anywhere other than in my own machine, but these are easy
  scripts, I don't think you cope any problems with them.
