  A lot of Linux distributions (and Mac) come with a handy command
  named&nbsp;<a href=  "http://linux.about.com/library/cmd/blcmdl1_pkill.htm"><strong>pkill</strong></a>
  installed by default. This command is very useful to kill
  processes in a more natural way.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of doing a kill/killall based on the ID of the process or
  the binary name, you can just pass a string that appears in any
  part of the process list, including the parameters you used to
  start a service.
</p>
<p>
  To kill the process you only have to type <code>pkill
  yourstring</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Example:
</p>
<pre>
$ ps -aux<br>root 32495 1 0 Sep24 ? 00:09:42 /bin/bash /root/deploy.sh<br>root 31054 1 0 Sep24 ? 00:09:44 /bin/bash /root/deploy.sh
</pre>
<pre>
# Kill both bash processes:<br>pkill deploy
</pre>
