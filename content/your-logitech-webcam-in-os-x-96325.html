<p>Tired of chatting or using Skype without video? For all of us who didn't have an Apple's iSight camera it's possible to use almost any PC USB webcam with Macam. Macam is a driver for USB webcams on Mac OS X.                It allows hundreds of USB webcams to be used by                many Mac OS X video-aware applications. Macam installation is very easy, you only have to copy the Macam component under /Library/Quicktime in your system. The package also contains a fast video viewer and snap shooter to test you webcam.</p>
