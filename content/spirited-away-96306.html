<p>With <strong>Sprited Away</strong> [<a href="http://drikin.com/spiritedaway/en">author</a>, <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/15844">MacUpdate</a>] you specify the maximum time of inactivity for your applications. When a program has been inactive for such a time it is automatically hidden by spirited away, so you don't have many annoying windows visible on the screen.</p>
<p>If there is any application you don't want to behave like this you only have to exlcude it in the top bar menu (See right image)</p>
<p>Spirited away doesn't have Dock icon nor interfere visually in any other place</p>
