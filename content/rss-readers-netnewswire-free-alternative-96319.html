<p><img style="float:left" src="http://www.harecoded.com/images/screenshot_01.jpg" alt="Icon" width="68" height="66" />I've tried several free RSS readers but the commercial NetNewsWire always seemed better to my opinion. Recentlly, I discovered <a href="http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.html">Vienna</a> which could be a great substitute. Tab navigation, smart folders, styles.... I'll give it a long try :)</p>
