<p>I've been stuck to Mandriva (formerly Mandrake) as my preferred Linux distro for over 2 years with a positive experience while testing dozens of different distros all that time. Today <em>is one of those days</em> and I decided to switch to Ubuntu (just to see what's out of the <em>Matrix</em>)</p>
<p>My first suprise with Ubuntu is that didn't come with the SSH server service installed, essential for me since I transfer files using SFTP.</p>
<p>If you want that service look for a package called <strong>openssh-server</strong> in the Synaptic manager or just type in the terminal*:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></p>
<p>*<small>Remember: You can open a terminal by pressing <em>Alt+F2</em>, typing <em>gnome-terminal</em> and pressing enter</small></p>
<p>It's been just one day and I am missing my beloved 'urpmi'...</p><p>There is no sshd server in ubuntu... unless you install the openssh-server package</p>
