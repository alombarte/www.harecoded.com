  repositories&nbsp;into a single one would usually be considered a
  bad strategy: as a rule of thumb, your code base should&nbsp;have
  several components isolated and then use a dependency manager
  (e.g: <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>) to
  bring&nbsp;them together.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, there are always many different scenarios and with
  them come different use cases, weird situations or just plain
  normal activities that would justify this procedure.&nbsp;In any
  case if you ever need to merge several repos into one, and still
  want to <strong>keep the git history</strong> this is an easy way
  to do it.
</p>
<p>
  The following technique is not rocket science and it's based in
  the <strong>simple addition of remotes and branch
  merging</strong>. If you expected something fancier I am sorry to
  tell you you'll find this boring.
</p>
<h3>
  Assumptions
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You have two, three (or N) repositories you want to merge
  inside a single (new)&nbsp;one.
  </li>
  <li>All the commit history of the three will be kept and
  browseable in the new one
  </li>
  <li>You want to merge everything in an empty repo named
  <code>repository-all-merged</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>repository</code>,<code>repository2</code> and
    <code>repository3</code> are the ones you want to glue together
  </li>
  <li>Every merged repo will end-up inside a new folder, wherever
  it is. If you do not want this, just skip the early steps.
  </li>
  <li>The&nbsp;<code>master</code>&nbsp;branch or any
  others&nbsp;will be present in the new repo as well.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Preparing the repositories
</h3>
<p>
  As we said, we are going to put every repo in a different folder
  inside the new one. This is what you need to do (you can copy
  sequentially the commands writing the right paths):
</p>
<p>
  Create a new directory and clone everything inside. The final
  repo and the existing ones. E.g:
</p>
<pre>
mkdir ~/all_repos_merged
cd all_repos_merged
git clone git@bitbucket.org:alombarte/repository-all-merged.git
git clone git@bitbucket.org:alombarte/repository.git
git clone git@bitbucket.org:alombarte/repository2.git
git clone git@bitbucket.org:alombarte/repository3.git
</pre>
<p>
  Now go to the first repository you want to import and create a
  new folder, and git-move all the content inside. The folder
  structure you create now is the folder you'll see in the merged
  repo. In the following example this first repo would appear under
  the <code>path/to/repository</code> folder.
</p>
<pre>
cd repository/
mkdir -p path/to/repository
git mv -k * path/to/repository/
git commit -m "Merging repositories like a boss"
</pre>
<p>
  Note that the <code>-k</code> flag ignores errors such as moving
  the newly created folder to itself. Before moving on with the
  next operation you might want to check that you don't have in
  each&nbsp;repos conflicting files, such as the
  <code>.gitignore</code>. You can delete those files and restore
  them later or you just fix the conflicts when they arise (edit
  the file, <code>git add</code> and then <code>git commit</code>:
  conflict solved).
</p>
<p>
  Now we prepare the second, third, forth... repository. Repeat the
  same N more times:
</p>
<pre>
    cd ../repository2/
    mkdir -p path/to/repository2
    git mv -k * path/to/repository2/
    git commit -m "Merging repositories like a boss"

    cd ../repository3/
    mkdir -p path/to/repository3
    git mv -k * path/to/repository3/
    git commit -m "Merging repositories like a boss"
</pre>
<p>
  <strong>CAUTION: You should never PUSH this changes to
  origin</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Commits are local in your computer and remember you want a new
  repo, not mess around with the existing ones.
</p>
<p>
  Now the three repos are "ready". Meaning they are all inside a
  new folder and content is not mixed.
</p>
<h3>
  Merging all the repos together in the new one
</h3>
<p>
  Next steps are having the just prepared repositories available
  for importing code in the final repository. With git you can
  reference any other external repository with the "remotes".
</p>
<p>
  Go to the final repo:
</p>
<pre>
cd ../repository-all-merged/
</pre>
<p>
  Add all the remotes for merging named <code>repository</code>,
  <code>repository2</code>, <code>repository3</code>... Note that
  although being a "remote" this repos are the ones you cloned in
  your local computer:
</p>
<pre>
    git remote add repository ~/all_repos_merged/repository
    git remote add repository2 ~/all_repos_merged/repository2/
    git remote add repository3 ~/all_repos_merged/repository3/

</pre>
<p>
  And this is the moment when we actually bring the changes to the
  final repo:
</p>
<pre>
<code>    git checkout master
    git pull repository master
</code>
</pre>
<p>
  Now we have in the <code>master</code> branch all the changes of
  <code>repository/master</code> branch. Conflicts might arise at
  this point (specially if you didn't do anything with the
  <code>gitignore</code>), but fixing them is as easy as:
</p>
<pre>
    vi .gitignore
    git add .gitignore
    git commit
</pre>
<p>
  And repeat for every other repo:
</p>
<pre>
    git pull repository2 master
    git pull repository3 master
    ...
</pre>
<p>
  Check that everything is in place:
</p>
<pre>
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>repository-all-merged</code> contains now all the code
  with all the history of the <code>master</code> branches. If you
  for instance need to import more branches it would be as easy as:
</p>
<pre>
git checkout another_branch
git pull repositoryN another_branch
</pre>
<p>
  If this merged repo has a remote, you can clean and push it now:
</p>
<pre>
git remote rm repository
git remote rm repository2
git remote rm repository3
git push
</pre>
<p>
  The rest of the repositories can be deleted, so you don't push by
  mistake later on.
</p>
