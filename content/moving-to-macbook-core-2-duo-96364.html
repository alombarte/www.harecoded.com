<p style="text-align: left;">I have owned 5 laptops for the last 6 years, which are a lot of laptops if you ask me... From a Toshiba Satellite with DSTN screen, going next to an IBM Thinkpad 600x and owning only macs since then: Powerbook G4 550 titanium, Powerbook G4 1Ghz 12" and, since yesterday, a shinny (second handed) Macbook 2 Core Duo.</p>
<p>All those machines were bought second handed and sold consequently. I have been lucky enough with all of them to never consider buying a new (from stores) laptop. And as such, I am very impressed with a lot of aspects of my new Macbook:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spectacular reflective screen (both in terms of size: 13", 1280x800 and visual quality).&nbsp;</li>
<li>SPEED. Much better than my lovely Powerbook G4 12".</li>
<li>Great design all over the place (it's from Apple anyway).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Battery: more than 4 hours (woow!).  This computer is going to stay for a loong time with me!</li>
</ul>
