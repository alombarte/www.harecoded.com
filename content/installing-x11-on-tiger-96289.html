<p>If you need X11 on Tiger for running applications like OpenOffice, WingIDE... you'll need the <strong>installation DVD</strong> or image. Mount it and install the package:</p>
<p><code>System/Installation/Packages/X11User.pkg</code></p>
<p>It's also available when you install Tiger under the <em>advanced</em> option, but  hey,<strong>don't waste more time looking for a download on apple site</strong>, the Panther days are over.</p><p>Stop surfing the net. There is nothing to download. Go look on your shelf for the installation DVD and there you'll find the X11User.pkg (System/Installation/Packages/)</p>
