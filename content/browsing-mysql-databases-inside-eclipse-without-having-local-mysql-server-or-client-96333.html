<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/eclipsesql/ title=">EclipseSQL</a> is an aid to people programming with databases. Allows to make queries, browse tables, change structures and all the common operations performed in databases. This is how it looks like:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thickbox" href="/img/posts/96333-83190.jpg" alt="96333-83190.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The application can be downloaded as a standalone (screenshot) although since I am using eclipse to develop PHP (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/index.php">PDT plugin</a>) and Java code, what I find more interesting is the plugin version. By installing the plugin another "View" called SQL is available, where you can browse the databases.</p>
<p>Recently I've been working mainly with MySQL, but since I work with remote sites and I don't have a mysql client neither a mysql server in my development machine, I found a strange error when connecting to the databases:</p>
<p><code><strong>Error: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver</strong></code> That happens when you don't have the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html">Connector/J 5.0</a> provided by mysql. To solve this go download the connector, place it under the eclipse's "plugins" folder and go to the SQLEditor preferences dialog. Then just click on <strong>Add External class</strong> and select the connector file. After clicking OK you'll see the mysql tick enabled.</p>
<p>Just to mention it, I tried to install the plugin from the update site direclty from eclipse but it failed.</p>
