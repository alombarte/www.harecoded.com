<p><a href="http://blogtk.sourceforge.net/">BloGTK</a> is a  weblog client that allows you to post to your weblog from Linux without the need for a separate browser window. This means that you can forget the <em>Wordpress</em> administration area (just to give an example of weblog)</p>
<p>BloGTK is compatible with many blogs using the XMLRPC. When configuring the application you only have to pass the absolute path where your xmlrpc file is and start writing. So now you can  work <em>offline</em> and when you finish writing the post, simply click on the "Post Entry" button and the entry will <strong>automagically</strong> appear on your site :)</p>
