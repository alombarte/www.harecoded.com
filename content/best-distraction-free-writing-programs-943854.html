<p>I am not a writer, but as many other mortals a lot of times I need to write long documents or put my ideas alltogether. For anyone who works with a computer and needs to write text in a non-distracting environment these tools will be very useful.</p>
<p>These programs usually are full-screen and only let you see the text you are typing, and usually plain text (without any formats). It might sound simple or even ridiculous, but I am more productive when I stop receiving notifications and being tempted of clicking on that little red number showing unread email or any other procastinators.</p>
<p>Here is the list of distraction-free software for both Windows and Mac.</p>
<h2>Distraction-free software for Mac</h2>
<p>This is the environment where I use this kind of programs the most.</p>
<h3>WriteRoom</h3>
<p>I used <a title="Distraction-free writing environment" href="http://writeroom.excellent-apps.com/:p:mac">WriteRoom</a> for free a couple of years ago, now the product has evolved and is commercial but surely the most complete of all.</p>
<h3>Ommwriter</h3>
<p>It comes in two flavours <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/en/free-download.html">Ommwriter Dana I</a> and <a href="http://ommwriter.excellent-apps.com/:p:mac">Ommwriter Dana II</a>. The first one is free, the second one is commercial, but you can pay the amount you want, minimum $4.11 <strong>I do use this program as my personal choice</strong>. Here is a video, and also lets you understand what all this programs are about:</p>
