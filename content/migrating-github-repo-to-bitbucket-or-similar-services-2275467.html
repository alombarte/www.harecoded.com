  <img title="" src=  "/img/posts/51b0f65e0eacbs14891.jpg" alt=  " TAGS:" align="left">Github is awesome. Bitbucket is awesome
  too. They are both excellent services, but Bitbucket has a
  plus:&nbsp;<strong>it's free for private repos</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  That's one of the reasons on why we decided to stop paying our
  $25/mo Github account for small projects and moved to Bitbucket.
  Although the Bitbucket guys have now a one-click "<a href=  "https://bitbucket.org/account/connected-accounts/">import from
  Github tool</a>", the solution is so simple that I don't even
  think it is worth using it. Because at the end of the day, even
  if you uset it you'll need to change by hand where your
  <em>origin</em> points to anyway.
</p>
<p>
  The following example is a <strong>Github to Bitbucket
  migration</strong> keeping the same files (no other clone
  needed). You can use this code for any service though, it works
  with any git repo:
</p>
<p>
  First of all <a href="https://bitbucket.org/repo/create">create
  your new blank repository</a> and then go to your shell and do:
</p>
<pre>
git pull
git push --mirror git@bitbucket.org:your_user/your_repo.git
git remote set-url origin git@bitbucket.org:your_user/your_repo.git
# or the same using HTTPS:
# git remote set-url origin https://bitbucket.org/your_user/your_repo.git
</pre>
<p>
  &nbsp;These three lines do the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get the last changes from your current
  <strong>origin</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Copy the entire repository (with all the commit data) to the
  new origin
  </li>
  <li>Change the old origin to the new location
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  After this you can git pull/push/whatever as if nothing happened.
  You don't need to clone anything again. You have <strong>Github
  migrated to Bitbucket!</strong>
