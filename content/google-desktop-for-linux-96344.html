<p>As a mac user at home, I've depended for a long time upon <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> to find stuff in my computer. Not the perfect solution, but at least does the trick. As an <a href="http://www.ubuntu.org">Ubuntu Linux</a> user at work, I tried <a href="http://beagle-project.org/Main_Page">Beagle</a> a long time ago but it was too unstable for my tastes... and never came back.  Now comes along <a href="http://desktop.google.com/en/linux/">Google Desktop for Linux</a>, with a lot of <a href="http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=844&amp;slide=1">politeness</a> and power. Hurrah!</p>
