<p>
  In Smarty sometimes you need to concatenate 2 variables and pass
  it as a single variable inside a&nbsp;block. But the placeholder
  won't allow any expected PHP syntax
</p>
<p>
  You want to accomplish something like:
</p>
<pre>
{assign var="MYVAR" value=$variable1.$variable2}
</pre>
<p>
  But, the dot in smarty is for array access, so, what about...
</p>
<pre>
{assign var="MYVAR" value=$variable1+$variable2}
</pre>
<p>
  <strong>No.</strong> It does not work either. Ah! <strong>Let's
  try a modifier</strong>:
</p>
<pre>
{assign var="MYVAR" value=$variable1|cat:$variable2}
</pre>
<p>
  <strong>Aha! That's the solution!</strong>
