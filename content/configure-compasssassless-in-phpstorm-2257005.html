  PHPStorm 6 bundles a <a href=  "http://blog.jetbrains.com/webide/2013/03/phpstorm-6-0-released-composer-code-rearranger-new-refactorings-rest-client-darcula-more/">
  new feature</a> called "File watchers" which enables
  <strong>Sass, LESS, SCSS, CoffeeScript, TypeScript
  transpilation.</strong> This option will compile your
  compass/scss/whatever files when the source file is saved (this
  is when you lose the focus or manually save).
</p>
<p>
  So, for the basic stuff you can stop using external programs and
  watchers like<a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>
  or <a href="http://incident57.com/less/">LESS.app</a>&nbsp;now.
  But of course unexpensive software like CodeKit is a must have if
  you are a frontend developer.
</p>
<p>
  Our frontend guy decided to use <a href=  "http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>&nbsp;using SCSS source
  files so, the following example illustrates how to
  <strong>configure Compass in PHPStorm under Mac OS X</strong>,
  but this is something reusable for the rest of the languages
  supported by watchers. The procedure is basically the same for
  the others.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, you have to install Compass. To do so open the
  Terminal and type:
</p>
<pre>
sudo gem install compass
</pre>
<p>
  Then go to PHPStorm and open any of the SCSS files in your
  project and you'll see after a second or two a message inviting
  you to use File watchers. This is going to add under
  <code>Preferences -&gt; File Watchers</code> a new entry that you
  can edit as follows:
</p>
<p>
  Program:&nbsp;<code>/usr/bin/compass</code><br>
  Arguments (If you compile files one by one):&nbsp;<code>compile
  &nbsp;$FilePath$</code><br>
  Arguments: (If you have SCSS in groups with ruby
  configurations):<br>
  <code>compile &nbsp;$ProjectFileDir$/relative/path/to/css/</code>
</p>
<p>
  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/5140a3fb46db9s146105.jpg"  alt=" - "></a>
</p>
<p>
  Now save the settings and every time you save one of these files
  you'll have the compiled SCSS file. Of course you can pass all
  the parameters you want in the section arguments to fit your
  needs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Ah, and this black theme is the Darcula theme that comes now
  bundled with the version 6.
