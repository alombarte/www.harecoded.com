<p>If you are using Finder it is possible to group all the folders instead of have them separated by the 'name sort' effect by doing a little hack.<br />Open finder and go (press Option+G to go directly) to</p>
<pre>/System/Library/Frameworks/ApplicationServices.framework/
Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/
A/Resources/Spanish.lproj

(text wrapped intentionally fo fit the page)
</pre>
<p>and change Spanish.lproj by your used language. Then drag and drop Localized.strings to your favorite text editor and add in the translation of "Folder" a leading space. e.g:</p>
<pre>Folder = 'Carpeta'   -- after
Folder = ' Carpeta'  -- before (note the space added in the beginning)
</pre>
<p>Then restart your computer or your session. Now you'll be able to sort by 'Kind' and all your apps will be grouped.</p>
