<p><a title="Quicksilver" href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> is for me the most useful application in the OS X environment. Few days ago someone shown me the same concept ported to Linux: <a title="Katapult" href="http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=33985">Katapult.</a> It's a long way to walk for Katapult to become as much powerful as Quicksilver is, but it gives to Linux users a very useful functionallity.  Despite Katapult is a KDE application I've been running it in Ubuntu (Gnome) without trouble. If you want to install it (ubuntu):  <code>sudo apt-get install katapult</code> In the picture you can see how I started typing "Beagle" to launch the indexer...</p>
