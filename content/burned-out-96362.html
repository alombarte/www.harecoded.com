<p>Sadly, the subject of this post is not related in any way to the console game.  Following is the actual state of my beloved car (as of beautiful, useful and non problematic), a 2005 Honda Civic which always worked like a charm.</p>

<p>The Civic was correctly parked in front of my house when yesterday at 3am the car next to him started burning and the flames took by assault my car as well: this is known as the "simpathy effect", I was told by a local policeman that I'm sure doesn't know a shit about fire in general and combustion in particular.</p>
<p>There were firemen and policemen (Mollet's local police and Mossos d'Esquadra) all over the place, but none of them seemed interested in investigating the origins of the fire. The cars were retired by our insurance  tow trucks and the place was partially cleaned by 6am.</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;pretty sure there won't be any investigation. Yesterday I made a formal complaint at the Mossos d'Esquadra police station, but they had made no report of yesterday affairs and were uninterested overall.  Sooo? my car is 80% burned, but I luckily had a total risk insurance and will see tomorrow how can I recover most of the car's&nbsp;value. I hope then to buy the same car model, as I am a loyalist to those material things that have worked well for me (except for computers and electronic gadgets).</p>

<p>Thanks for all the support I've received these days.</p>
