<p>If you want to test the <a href="http://www.wired.com/software/softwarereviews/news/2007/11/firefox3beta">Firefox 3 new features</a> on your Ubuntu Gutsy installation, but don't want to loose all the Firebug niceties for developing web apps, here are some quick and dirty steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$ sudo apt-get install Firefox-3.0</code> (upgrades/downgrades to kernel 2.6.20... weird!)</li>
<li>&nbsp;Go to the <a href="http://fireclipse.xucia.com/#Downloads">Fireclipse</a> site and download <strong>Firebug-1.1.0b10.xpi</strong>. This is a modified version from the firebug original, compatible with Firefox 3.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Open Firefox 3, install the xpi by drag &amp; drop to the firefox window.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>Voila! There you are...</p>

<p>Firefox 3 is in its early stages and it shows: there are some cosmeting issues here and there, the enter key doesn't work in the url field, etc. Anyhow, you can test whether the browser's memory consumption has gone to less crazy numbers, and how quick is the rendering of its new Gecko 1.9 engine. You won't screw Firefox 2 with this installation, so there is nothing to loose.  If your are brave people (like us) and put to test this Firefox 3 beta, please tell us your impressions!</p>
