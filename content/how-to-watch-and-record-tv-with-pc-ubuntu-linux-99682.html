<p>There are many alternatives when we speak of media centers, but I can't figure out anything other than a computer. It offers all the functionallity you could want in a well-known interface. That's why I have a PC in the living room, I browse the Internet using my TV (using an HDMI cable) and now I record stuff when I am not at home. This is how I did it</p>
<p>If you want to have a complete media center solution with Ubuntu, you should take a deep look at <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a>. A true PVR with a lot of features, but it's not easy to have it up and running. You need to spend a little bit of time with the configuration, so if you want to watch digital television (DVB) in a few minutes I propose installing <a href="https://launchpad.net/me-tv">Me TV</a>. At least to see if your TV card is working ;)</p>
<p>Me TV it's available via apt-get if you add the launchpad repository. To do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Execute (ALT+F2):<code>sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list</code></li>
<li>Then add this two lines and save:<br /><code>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/michael-lamothe/ubuntu gutsy main</code><br /><code>deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/michael-lamothe/ubuntu gutsy main</code></li>
</ul>
<p>After that, you only need to update the sources and install the program:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo apt-get update</code></li>
<li><code>sudo apt-get install me-tv</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you have Me TV under the menu Applications -&gt; Image and Sound -&gt; Me TV</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="thickbox" href="/img/posts/99682-83155.jpg" alt="99682-83155.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want your tv card working on a Linux box, ensure you are using the latest kernel. Ubuntu 8 is a good choice, or you can try also Linux MCE.</li>
<li>Not all the hardware is supported. <a href="http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/DVB-T_Devices">Check yours</a>. I bought a Pinnacle PC DVB-T that I had to refund back because didn't work. Now I have a Hauppauge WinTV NOVA-T that works like a charm</li>
<li>Install <strong>lirc</strong> (<code>sudo apt-get install lirc</code>) for remote control support</li>
</ul>
