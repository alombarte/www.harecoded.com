  <img title="" src=  "/img/posts/5442d744df785s8396.jpg" alt=  " TAGS:undefined" align="left">When it comes to rename files via
  command line there is no rename utility under OS X without
  installing <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a>. But I still
  never needed to install it since there is a lot you can do by
  just making use of the <strong>shell parameter
  expansion</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>parameter expansion</strong> allows you to manipulate
  variables in a very convenient way and when mixed with the mv
  command you have an unstoppable renaming tool. Let's see first
  what are variables and what is this parameter expansion:
</p>
<pre>
$ var='PIC0001.JPG'
$ echo ${var}
PIC0001.JPG

</pre>
<p>
  In the example above you can see that we have assigned the value
  PIC0001.JPG to a variable named var and in the next line we have
  just printed its content. The same example with a little bit of
  magic:
</p>
<pre>
$ echo ${var/PIC/2014_Holiday_}
2014_Holiday_0001.JPG

</pre>
<p>
  Here I substituted the ugly PIC preffix used by the photo camera
  and added the title of the album. We'll see the details on how
  this works later on.
</p>
<p>
  Now if I wanted to <strong>rename all the pictures</strong> from
  the command line I would just iterate over all them:
</p>
<pre>
for file in *.JPG; do echo mv "$file" "${file/PIC/2014_Holiday_}"; done

</pre>
<p>
  You can safely execute the previous command, no change will be
  made to this files because we added the echo to just show the
  command to be executed. Delete it to make changes effective.
</p>
<p>
  Now that we have seen a simple example for remaning let's get
  deeper on what you can do with <strong>parameter
  expansion</strong> with some examples.
</p>
<p>
  In order to do some safe testing I would recommend creating a new
  directory and inside put some random empty files:
</p>
<pre>
for i in $(seq 1 100); do touch "$i-${RANDOM}-$i.txt"; done

</pre>
<p>
  That will create something like:
</p>
<pre>
$ ls
1-21912-1.txt     2-16712-2.txt   3-22319-3.txt   ...

</pre>
<p>
  Now that you have the dummy files test and understand the
  following examples:
</p>
<h2>
  &nbsp;Replacing patterns with strings
</h2>
<p>
  The format of this expansion is:
</p>
<pre>
# Replace first match of the pattern only:
${variable/pattern/replace}

# Replace all matches of the pattern:
${variable//pattern/replace}

</pre>
<p>
  And now a batch example, <strong>replace all dashes in files by
  underscores</strong>:
</p>
<pre>
for file in *.*; do echo mv "$file" "${file//-/_}"; done


mv 1-21912-1.txt 1_21912_1.txt
mv 10-848-10.txt 10_848_10.txt
mv 100-26921-100.txt 100_26921_100.txt
...

</pre>
<p>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Note that the double slash // will
  replace all matching appearances, but if you use just one slash
  then the replacement will stop after the first match. Try it.
</p>
<h2>
  Remove a pattern from the beginning
</h2>
<p>
  The format of this expansion is:
</p>
<pre>
# Remove the pattern in the beginning:
${variable#pattern}

# Remove the pattern in the beginning (longest match possible):
${variable##pattern}

</pre>
<p>
  In action, <strong>remove the first part</strong> of the file:
</p>
<pre>
$ for file in *.*; do echo mv "$file" "${file#*-}"; done

mv 1-21912-1.txt 21912-1.txt
mv 10-848-10.txt 848-10.txt
mv 100-26921-100.txt 26921-100.txt
...

</pre>
<p>
  See the difference when using ##:
</p>
<pre>
$ for file in *.*; do echo mv "$file" "${file##*-}"; done
mv 1-21912-1.txt 1.txt
mv 10-848-10.txt 10.txt
mv 100-26921-100.txt 100.txt

</pre>
<p>
  The double hash ## is matching with the longest possibility and
  taking the last - in the file.
</p>
<h2>
  Remove a pattern at the end
</h2>
<p>
  The format of this expansion is:
</p>
<pre>
# Remove the pattern at the end:
${variable%pattern}

# Remove the pattern at the end (longest match possible):
${variable%%pattern}

</pre>
<p>
  This works exactly like the previous expansion but matching the
  end. An example of <strong>removing the extension</strong>:
</p>
<pre>
for file in *.*; do echo mv "$file" "${file%.txt}"; done

mv 1-21912-1.txt 1-21912-1
mv 10-848-10.txt 10-848-10
mv 100-26921-100.txt 100-26921-100
...

</pre>
<h2>
  Replace only a substring
</h2>
<p>
  Just like any substring function in a variety of languages, the
  format is:
</p>
<pre>
# Cut string from offset:
${variable%offset}
# Cut string from offset until length:
${variable%offset:length}

</pre>
<p>
  Remove 3 first characters:
</p>
<pre>
for file in *.*; do echo mv "$file" "${file:3}"; done

mv 1-21912-1.txt 1912-1.txt
mv 10-848-10.txt 848-10.txt
mv 100-26921-100.txt -26921-100.txt

</pre>
<p>
  Take from the 3rd and then 5 characters:
</p>
<pre>
for file in *.*; do echo mv "$file" "${file:3:5}"; done

mv 1-21912-1.txt 1912-
mv 10-848-10.txt 848-1
mv 100-26921-100.txt -2692

</pre>
