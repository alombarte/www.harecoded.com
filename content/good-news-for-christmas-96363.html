<p>Well, this has not been a good year overall for me, but it seems it might end a little better than it started...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fiatc.es/">FIATC</a>, my burned car's insurance company is doing a straight good job, so I will get a fair compensation for <a href="http://www.harecoded.com/burned-out">my car's lost</a>, hopefully over the next week. Hurrah!  Now that it seems 70% of the cash invested in my poor 2 years old Honda Civic is going to be restored, I am looking for some candidates to choose the car that will drive my ways everyday... <a href="http://www.honda.es">Honda</a> and <a href="http://www.mazda.es">Mazda</a> are my favourite brands by far as they have excellent cars in terms of motors, design and quality overall.</p>
<p>This weekend I'll have to take a tough decision, which car will I buy? An Honda CR-V, HR-V, maybe a Civic again? a georgeus Mazda 3?  Today has been a strange/fine day for more reasons... I proudly work for <a href="http://www.atrapalo.com">Atrapalo.com</a> (Barcelona) as a web developer, and we have spent part of the day <a href="http://atrapalopuntoblog.com/708/concurso-de-decoracion-navidena-en-atrapalo/">decorating our offices with Christmas related themes</a>...</p>
<p>This is our humble contribution to the party, an IT department megamacho poster with a snowy touch:</p>

<p>Ain't we creative people sometimes?  Merry Christmas!!!</p>
