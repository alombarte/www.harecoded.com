  <a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/516c5e58b5568s91056.jpg"  alt=" TAGS:" align="left"></a>It might seem very obvious to you
  that if you <strong>migrate from Posterous&nbsp;blogs to another
  service</strong> your <strong>images should be
  transitioned</strong> as well.
</p>
<p>
  If you want a <strong>free service</strong> (as Posterous was)
  there are only two options where you can migrate your Posterous
  to without writing all your posts one by one&nbsp;again:
</p>
<p>
  1)&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> (but
  <strong>losing all the images</strong>)<br>
  2)&nbsp;<a href="/posterous.obolog.com?hl=en">Obolog.com</a> (and
  <strong>keeping all the images</strong>)
</p>
<p>
  So, if you want your blog back including images the only option
  you have is Obolog. There are no other free services in the net
  (or at least I didn't find other) where you can bring back to
  life your Posterous blog. If you have already migrated to
  wordpress go and see where your images are pointing to. You'll be
  disappointed because all the posts reference posterous server,
  and they will be shut down in a few days.
</p>
<p>
  If you still wonder what Obolog is, you are just reading one
  right now. Harecoded is powered by Obolog and it has been running
  smoothly for several years so far.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to try it all you have to do is to upload your ZIP
  backup file into the <strong><a href=  "http://posterous.obolog.com?hl=en">Posterous migration
  script</a></strong>. But remember, on April 30th if you don't
  have the ZIP everything will be gone for good.
