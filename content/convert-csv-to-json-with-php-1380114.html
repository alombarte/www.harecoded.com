<p>
  Imagine a data list dumped in a plain text file (e.g: CSV) and
  you need to convert it to JSON format. You could use this simple
  php script to do such task.
</p>
<p>
  It's the simplest version but from here you can customize it to
  fit your requeriments.
</p>
<p>
  Usage:
</p>
<pre>
php script_name.php file_to_convert.csv &gt; result.json
</pre>
<p>
  The script:
</p>
<pre>
$csv = file_get_contents( $argv[1] );<br> $csv = explode("\n", trim($csv) );<br> <br> foreach ( $csv as &amp;$line )<br> {<br>     $line = trim( $line );<br> }<br> <br> print json_encode($csv);
</pre>
<p>
  This example covers a "single column" CSV file. If you want to
  add several columns you only need to add an <code>explode</code>
  with the separator character, be comma, somicolon or tab.
