<p>Autumn is the worth conferences season for us. It seems that every autumn brings the interesting subjects and this November we (Manuel and myself, Albert) are attending at the <a href="http://www.phpconference.com/">PHP Conference 2005</a> held in Frankfurt, Germany. Last year was the <a href="http://plone.org/events/conferences/2/">Plone Conference 2004</a>.</p>
<p>Since we are a couple of sick men, when we assist to a software conference we need to take with us a laptop (mac os x) having pre-installed the matter. The "problem" was that PHP on Mac OS X is not as trivial to install and since we haven't much free time for installing PHP5 and resolving all the dependencies I looked around for a quick solution, and I found it on <a href="http://www.entropy.ch">Marc Liyanage</a> page. Marc offers a self-contained package which installs php and many additional modules with the well-known install package wizard.</p>
<h4>Hands on [1 minute]...</h4>
<p>The aforementioned product can be found at <a href="http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/">http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/</a>. Take a look for specific information like modules, PHP4 or different Apache versions. Amongst others I found interesting the MySQL,PostgreSQL, XML-RPC, GNU gettext, GD and PEAR modules (let's check what happens with <a href="hpt://adodb.sf.net">ADOdb</a>)</p>
<p>As I have the default mac install <strong>what I did</strong> was:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www2.entropy.ch/download/Entropy-PHP-5.0.4-1.dmg">downloading the file for Apache 1.3 and Mac OS 10.3/10.4</a></li>
<li>Installing the package</li>
<li>Restarting apache (from terminal: <tt>sudo apachectl restart</tt>)</li>
<li>Creating a test file in your webroot (defaults to <tt>~/Sites</tt>)</li>
<li>Checking it in the browser <tt>http://localhost/~youruser/testing-php5.php</tt></li>
</ul>
