<p>If you have messed up your <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a> application preferences you can aways <strong>return to the factory settings</strong> by deleting your iTerm preferences file. Just delete the following file:</p>
<pre>rm ~/Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.iTerm.plist</pre>
<p>This will delete your profiles, very useful when you have remapped keys and you can't remember how to go back.</p>
