<p>It's usual to find many distributions without MP3 support due to licensing issues. If you have MP3 files and don't know how to play them do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the terminal</li>
<li>Type <tt>sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list</tt></li>
<li>Remove comments to packages (This is erasing the # characters in lines starting with <tt>##deb</tt>)</li>
<li>Save changes and close gedit</li>
<li>Update the packages <tt>sudo apt-get update</tt></li>
<li>Install the mulitmedia codecs:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.8-plugins gstreamer0.8-lame gstreamer0.8-ffmpeg w32codecs libdivx4linux lame sox ffmpeg mjpegtools vorbis-tools gst-register-0.8</code></p>
<p>Now you can open a player like Rythmbox or Kaffeine and start listening songs. <strong>Totem won't play mp3 with this</strong>. To associate mp3 files with a player, right-clic on a mp3 file and go to "Open with" tab.</p>
