<p><a href="http://pam-ya.com/en/">U*Blog</a> is a fantastic application for publishing content in blogs from your palm device. It quickly shows it is well thought out, with clear functionalities and uncluttered interface. And best of all, it is freeware.  U*Blog supports MovableType, Metaweblog and Blogger API compliant bloggers, which covers pretty much all the systems out there.  This is my configuration for posting to a wordpress blog:</p>
<pre>Name:	harecoded
Type:	<strong>MovableType</strong>
User:	myuser
Pwd:	mypwd
Host:	www.harecoded.com
XML-RPC path:
        /xmlrpc.php
Blog id: 	click to find button
</pre>

<p>The only item to explain is the 'click to find' button, which tries to connect to the blog server and retrieves and id (1 in my case) if everything is ok.</p>
<p>And that's all, in less than 5 minutes you will be posting to your blog.</p><p>U*Blog is a fantastic application for publishing content in blogs from your palm device.</p>
