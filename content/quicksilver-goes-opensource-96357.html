<p>The excellent launcher (and much more) <a href="http://www.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver </a>that Mac users have been using for so long has been opensourced. This is great news, since more developers can join the product and improve it and extend it.</p>

<p>My hope is that someone will make a cross-platform version, or other projects like Launchy or gnome-launch will add more features thanks to quicksilver knowledgebase.  The code can be reached via <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/">Google Code</a>.</p>
