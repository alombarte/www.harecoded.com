<p><strong>Manel Aguilar</strong> and <strong>Albert Lombarte</strong>&nbsp;met back in the studying days. Although they took different paths in life after computer studies they have found themselves sharing companies a couple of times. They work now as managers but despite not being very much in contact they keep sharing different web projects, and of course, same interest in gadgetry, apple stuff, spanglish perfectioning, beer consuming, just to mention some of them.  They live in <a title="Cheap flights to BCN (Europe)" href="http://www.whichbudget.com/en/cheapflights.php?to=BCN" target="_blank">Barcelona, Spain</a> where they enjoy an <a title="Current conditions" href="http://weather.cnn.com/weather/forecast.jsp?locCode=SPXX0015&amp;zipCode=267633826667" target="_blank">excellent climate</a> with their wives and kids.</p>
