<p>
  It is in your mind, like a worm that eats away the apple, "<em>I
  have to switch to Git</em>". And one day it happens and you
  realize that it was not that diffcult.
</p>
<p>
  I started using Git as my local repository, but still using SVN
  as the central repository with git itself thanks to the <code>git
  svn</code>&nbsp;set of commands. After some time I decided to
  entirely move the vast majority of projects from SVN to Git but
  of course not by creating a new fresh and empty repository but
  importing the whole&nbsp;<strong>svn commit history</strong>, as
  if the commits were made using Git itself ten years ago.
</p>
<p>
  This is how you can do it:
</p><h3>
  Import SVN repo to Git: Transition guide
</h3>
<p>
  I did this on mac several times, but you can do it in other
  systems as well. First of all, open up a terminal, and install
  the fantastic tool <a href=  "https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git">svn2git</a>. The one-liners
  are:
</p>
<pre>
#Ubuntu only:
sudo apt-get install git-core git-svn ruby rubygems
# Others: svn2git installation:
sudo gem install svn2git --source http://gemcutter.org
</pre>
<p>
  Then you have available the new svn2git command. Create a new
  directory:
</p>
<pre>
mkdir mygitrepo
cd mygitrepo/
</pre>
<p>
  Depending on the structure of your SVN repositories you have to
  play with the options of svn2git, the <a href=  "https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git#readme">README</a> is pretty
  clear. If you don't want to import the whole <code>trunk/ tags/
  branches/</code> and pick a single branch or folder, no matter
  how you named it then you have to do something like this:
</p>
<pre>
svn2git http://svn.myrepo.com/myproject --rootistrunk --username yourusername
</pre>
<p>
  Ensure to launch this command inside the new folder! <strong>But
  wait! We forgot to map the SVN usernames to Git
  usernames.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  If you intend to upload this git repo to an external service like
  Github or Bitbucket I would recommend using the exact usernames
  there are in those services. You need the file that says what SVN
  username corresponds with which Git usernames. The file you have
  to create is <code>~/.svn2git/authors</code> and the syntax looks
  like this:
</p>
<pre>
svnusername = gitusername
</pre>
<p>
  For instance, the users "albert" and "obokaman", etc... in my
  local SVN repo correspond to the following in GitHub:
</p>
<pre>
albert = alombarte
obokaman = obokaman-com<br>root = alombarte<br>pablo = pablor
</pre>
<p>
  <strong>It is very important that you add all the authors that
  ever commited to your repository</strong>&nbsp;in this
  &nbsp;~/.svn2git/authors file. This is why I added root in the
  example.&nbsp;When this is complete, run the previous command.
</p>
<p>
  Now you have a git repository with all the svn history. Maybe the
  next thing to do would be <a href=  "http://www.harecoded.com/upload-an-existing-git-repository-to-remote-github-bitbucket-beanstalk-1314699">
