<p>
  I do store a lot of statistical data in Redis, storing
  information on what users do and behave every day, week, month
  and so on... But storing a huge amount of data in memory has a
  little drawback: memory is cheap and fast, <strong>but is
  finite</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  From time to time (e.g: <em>cron job</em>) I need to clean up the
  house because there is too much memory filled that is no longer
  interesting to keep it. Maybe you are thinking now, <em>why this
  guy is not setting an EXPIRATION date?</em> Well, I do.
</p>
<p>
  Problem is that with early versions of Redis after the expiration
  time <strong>a KEY won't be really deleted from memory until the
  next access to the key, which never might happen</strong>. There
  is also a random process that deletes keys and there was a change
  of behaviour regarding expiration in Redis 2.2, &nbsp;<a title=  "Expiring keys in Redis" href=  "http://redis.io/topics/expire">read more on expiration here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In my case, I do store keys using human-readable dates as part of
  the key name, which I need to delete by pattern. To make it more
  graphical with a similar example, imagine you are storing user
  behavior in keys named like:
</p>
<p>
  <code>ub:2011-08-18:id-tracked-page...</code>
</p>
<p>
  Decomposing the elements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>ub: <em>user-behavior</em> alias
  </li>
  <li>2011-08-18: Stores all the events for <em>August 18th</em>
  </li>
  <li>id-tracked-page: Name or code of the <em>page</em> I want to
  track (e.g: <em>home</em>)
  </li>
  <li>... more constraints could be added
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then, I am not interested in last month's data (July) regarding
  user behaviour so I can trigger in the terminal the following
  command:
</p>
<pre>
redis-cli -n 0 KEYS ub:2011-07-* | xargs redis-cli -n 0 DEL
</pre>
<p>
  This <strong>deletes all the redis keys based on this
  pattern</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The output would produce something like:
</p>
<pre>
$ redis-cli -n 0 KEYS ub:2011-07-* | xargs redis-cli -n 0 DEL
(integer) 188
(integer) 175
(integer) 191
(integer) 186
(integer) 153
</pre>
<p>
  You should notice that there is a <strong>-n 0</strong> in the
  command indicating to trigger the command in the DATABASE 0.
  Since I do have many databases in a single server (multiple
  database support will be removed soon) I do always specify it. If
  you use a single database, just drop the "-n 0".
</p>
<p>
  Also, you might need to surround by quotes the pattern part if
  contains spaces or other unfriendly chars.
</p>
<p>
  Hope this helps
