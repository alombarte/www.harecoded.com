  The following recipe is an&nbsp;easy&nbsp;way to get your full
  Flickr account backed up in Amazon S3 or similar cloud storage.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you have a really good Internet connection at home or you
  are doing a backup of a small library the first thing to do would
  be to create&nbsp;a machine in the cloud, such as Digital Ocean
  or Amazon EC2 so you can have a high throughput. Once the process
  is finished you can destroy the machine and the whole operation
  will cost you a few cents. When creating the
  droplet/instance&nbsp;make sure to create a machine that has
  enough disk space to hold your library.
</p>
<p>
  In my case I had some free credit in Digital Ocean so&nbsp;I did
  it there, but of course you can create a machine in EC2 and
  persist directly in S3, or you can also do this in Google Cloud.
</p>
<p>
  The process consists in&nbsp;two simple steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download all the pictures from Flickr using&nbsp;<a href=  "https://github.com/dan/hivelogic-flickrtouchr">Flickrtouchr</a>
  </li>
  <li>Sync&nbsp;all the downloaded pictures to S3 or other cloud
  storage using&nbsp;<a href="http://rclone.org/">Rclone</a>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>
  Install the software
</h3>
<pre>
apt-get update<br>apt-get install --yes git unzip screen
</pre>
<pre>
wget http://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-v1.28-linux-amd64.zip
unzip rclone-v1.28-linux-amd64.zip
mv ~/rclone-v1.28-linux-amd64/rclone /usr/local/bin/rclone
</pre>
<p>
  The substitute the following lines with your own Amazon Access
  Key ID and secret
</p>
<pre>
echo "
[S3]
type = s3
env_auth = false
access_key_id = ABCDEFGH1234567890IJK
secret_access_key = aBcDefghHijKl123456mnopqrst
region = us-east-1
endpoint =
location_constraint =
" &gt; ~/.rclone.conf

</pre>
<p>
  Install the script that downloads pictures from Flickr:
</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/dan/hivelogic-flickrtouchr.git
cd hivelogic-flickrtouchr
mkdir FlickrBackupFolder/

</pre>
<h3>
  Download all your Flickr pictures
</h3>
<p>
  It is recommended to use screen so you can recover the session
  anytime
</p>
<pre>
screen -d -m -S "Flickr download" python flickrtouchr.py FlickrBackupFolder
# screen -ls
# screen -r PID
# CTRL+a :detach
</pre>
<h3>
  Upload pictures to S3
</h3>
<pre>
rclone copy ~/hivelogic-flickrtouchr/FlickrBackupFolder/ S3:your-bucket-name
</pre>
<p>
  Done!
