<p>
  If you are a Google Reader reader you have certainly seen the
  message that is going to disappear by July 1st 2013. If you read
  from mobile then plenty of cool apps like Flipboard you can use,
  but when it comes to a web-based interface these are the
  alternatives I found worth using.
</p>
<p>
  The first thing you should do before it is too late is to
  <strong><a href=  "https://www.google.com/takeout/#custom:reader">download a copy
  of your Google Reader feeds using Takeout</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Then take your time to pick another service, there are plenty.
</p>
<h2>
  Prismatic
</h2>
<p>
  If you log in using your Google account then <strong style=  "font-size: 0.9em;">there is nothing you have to import</strong>.
  All your feeds will be there in a fashion way with big images and
  a nice presentation. I like it way more than Google Reader, but
  if you have hundreds of places you are subscribed to maybe you'd
  prefer something that does not display all the images and shows
  as a list instead. It looks more like a new sites than a RSS
  reader, but it is pretty cool.

<h2>
  The Old Reader
</h2>
<p>
  Subscriptions are presented quite similar to Google Reader. You
  need to <a href=  "https://www.google.com/takeout/#custom:reader"><strong>download
  your Google subscriptions</strong></a> if you want to import them
  here. But it seems that right now, the site is under a lot of
  load:<a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/51419f2373b9es46547.jpg"><br></a>This
  is how it looks like:

<h2>
  Feedly
</h2>
<p>
  Finally <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a> seems to be
  the on of the most commented in the Twitter timeline so far, and
  looks very nice too. They claim that <a href=  "http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/">the transition
  will be transparent</a> for the users if you connect to Google
  Reader with a project they are working on called Normandy. What I
  like the most is that you can select how you want to display the
  information, a list, a mosaic, anything :)
