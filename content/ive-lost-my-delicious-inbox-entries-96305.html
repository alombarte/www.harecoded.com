<p><img style="float:left;" src="http://www.harecoded.com/images//delicious-inbox.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="90" />This morning <a href="http://del.icio.us ">del.icio.us</a> was down for maintenance. Some hours after I went back to my inbox to read my daily colleagues entries... BUT NOTHING WAS THERE!! I had a lot of them...</p>
<p><br /> Are they going to appear again?</p>
<p><strong>Update (dec, 19):</strong> del.icio.us worked for a while but now there is an odd message:</p>
<p><q>Due to the power outage earlier in the week, we appear a number of continued hiccups. We've taken everything offline to properly rebuild and restore everything. I apologize and hope to have this resolved as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. Updates will be posted on our blog as we have them.</q></p>
<p><strong>Update (dec,20):</strong> Del.icio.us is back online again. Any of you missed a backup?</p>
