<p>As if I were a teenager, yesterday I found an mp3 song that I hadn't heard in maybe ten years and a smile came to my face when I imagined that it could be played in my mobile when I need a loud tone (I am on of those who preffer having it silent all the time)</p>
<p>So I passed the MP3 directly to the mobile but it failed, the mobile can play it but can't be set as ringtone. Rapidly browsed my default existing tones and I saw some AAC files, and I thought to myself... Isn't iTunes importing CD's by default in AAC format? .... and YES</p>
<p>So if you want to set as ringtone one or several mp3 files, <strong>open iTunes</strong> and go to:</p>
<pre>Preferences-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Import</pre>
<p>and select <strong>Import using: AAC codec</strong></p>
<p>Then <strong>select all the files you want to convert</strong> and select the menu:</p>
<pre>Advanced -&gt; Convert selection to AAC</pre>
<p>Now you can send the converted files to your mobile via bluetooth/whatever, save the file, and set it as ringtone :)</p>
<p>NOTE: That works for my old but useful <a href="http://www.nokia.es/A4180199">Nokia 6630</a> with GPS and TomTom. I don't know much about which manufacturers are accepting AAC format, maybe your mobile is even accepting MP3 directly as ringtone.</p>
