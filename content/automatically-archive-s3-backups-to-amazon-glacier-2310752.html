  <strong><a class="thickbox" href=  "/img/posts/52a249a75d9b4s72243.jpg"><br></a><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/en/s3/">Amazon
  S3</a></strong> is an on-cloud storage service used in a variety
  of scenarios. On of these common scenarios is the one where you
  upload your server backups to S3 using any of the multiple
  convenient libraries and tools.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  In the other hand, Amazon offers another service more oriented to
  data archiving and backup named <a href=  "http://aws.amazon.com/es/glacier/"><strong>Amazon
  Glacier</strong></a>. If you store a lot of data (and I am not
  talking about &nbsp;a couple of GB) then you can save money using
  Glacier instead of S3.&nbsp;Although the S3 service is sold as
  "infinitely scalable and highly durable" the bills work the same
  way and if you store TB than you might consider moving to
  Glacier.
</p>
<p>
  Now S3 offers an option to automatically move (or delete) data
  from the S3 buckets to Glacier. It is called
  "<strong>Lifecycle</strong>" an you'll find it when logging to
  the AWS Console and showing the Properties tab.

</p>
<p>
  From there you can create a rule that <strong>when an object is
  XX days old it will be moved from S3 to Glacier
  automatically</strong> (<a href=  "http://aws.amazon.com/en/s3/faqs/#How_is_my_storage_charge_calculated_for_Amazon_S3_objects_archived_to_Amazon_Glacier">charges
  apply</a>), or you can delete it as well.
</p>
<p>
  Now it's time to make numbers, <strong>the difference in pricing
  between S3 and Glacier is huge</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Save data in S3 (US Standard): $0.125 per GB up to 1TB. More
  expensive beyond that space used.
  </li>
  <li>Save data in&nbsp;Glacier(US East Virginia): $0.01 per GB /
  month
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
