<p>When you plug an iBook 12" to an external monitor you get two duplicated screens. As they are duplicated, the maximum resolution is imposed by your iBook, this is 1024x768 pixels, no matter your second monitor can do 1600x1200.</p>
<p>I bought an iBook 12" because it's really portable and lightweight, but for intensive work, a 1024x768 pixels resolution is absolutely not healthy . We need a solution!</p>

<p>In order to remove duplication to let your 2nd monitor work with freedom you have to make some changes in the <tt>System Preferences/Screens</tt> panel, under the tab <tt>Align</tt>. But in small ibooks and other models, that option was removed by apple (to make your life easier?)/p&gt;</p>
<p>There's still a chance to re-enable it, you can check if your <a title="List of supported hardware" href="http://www.rutemoeller.com/mp/ibook/supportlist_e.html">mac model is supported</a> and install the patch (at your own risk) <a title="Go to the author website" href="http://www.rutemoeller.com/mp/ibook/ibook_e.html">Screen Spanning Doctor</a>. After rebooting, you'll see the new tab.</p>
<p>Personally I tested the patch in two different iBooks G4 1.2Ghz and 1.4Ghz and everything went fine...</p><p>How to increase display resolution on a 2nd monitor using an iBook or iMac and enable multiple desktops for the same price</p>
