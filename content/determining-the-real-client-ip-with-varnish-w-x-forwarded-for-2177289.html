<p>
  If you implement Varnish in your application one of the early
  things that you discover is that &nbsp;any IP functionalities you
  had are now gone. Some examples are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>GEOIP does not resolve the country
  </li>
  <li>Apache logs write 127.0.0.1 as request client IP (or another
  IP of your LAN)
  </li>
  <li>My own PHP logic cannot longer apply filters by IP
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Why? Well, it's easy to answer. That's because your
  <strong>Apache or Ngnix will receive the request from Varnish,
  not from the real client</strong> as it used to be.
</p>
<p>
  But that has an easy fix. All you need to do is to tell Varnish
  to send the client IP to the backend. This can be easily
  accomplished by setting in your VLC
  (<code>/etc/varnish/default.vcl</code>) the following:
</p>
<pre>
sub vcl_recv {

# IP forwarding.
if (req.restarts == 0) {
        if (req.http.x-forwarded-for) {
                set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = req.http.X-Forwarded-For + ", " + client.ip;
        } else {
                set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
        }
}
...
</pre>
<div class="msg-info">
  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> IP forwarding code updated to make it
  work with people behind proxies, as noted by Albert and Zillur in
  the comments.
</div>
<p>
  With this change your &nbsp;application will be able to get the
  client IP and resolve correctly the country using GeoIP. When
  your application needs the client IP you only have to access to
  the header&nbsp;<strong>X-Forwareded-For.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  But caution! If you ALWAYS want that header set in every request,
  you need to add this:
</p>
<pre>
 sub vcl_pipe {
     # Note that only the first request to the backend will have
     # X-Forwarded-For set.  If you use X-Forwarded-For and want to
     # have it set for all requests, make sure to have:
     # set bereq.http.connection = "close";
     # here.  It is not set by default as it might break some broken web
     # applications, like IIS with NTLM authentication.

     set bereq.http.connection = "close";
     return (pipe);
 }
</pre>
<p>
  Now, &nbsp;you might want to see the original IP in the apache
  logs too. To do that you have to use a custom log that prints the
  <strong>X-Forwareded-For</strong> header. Just add inside your
  Virtualhost declaration:
</p>
<pre>
LogFormat "%{X-Forwarded-For}i %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" varnish
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/access_combined_SOMEDOMAIN.log varnish
</pre>
<p>
  You should also have in mind that this configuration is appended,
  so it might happen that you vcl has already a line like this, so
  you are doing it twice. See the commented code in the default.vcl
  file.
</p>
<p>
  The latest VCL file includes already the client.ip, just that it
  might appear twice! Copy all the file and tune the lines you like
</p>
<p>
  Mine looks more or less like this
</p>
<pre>
sub vcl_recv {

    # IP forwarding.
    if (req.restarts == 0) {
        if (req.http.x-forwarded-for) {
            set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = req.http.X-Forwarded-For + ", " + client.ip;
        } else {
            set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
        }
    }

     # Ignore all requests from Working Copies
     if ( req.http.host ~ "([a-z]{2,3}\.development\.lan)$" )
     {
        return(pipe);
     }

     unset req.http.Cookie;

#Copy paste...

     if (req.request != "GET" &amp;&amp;
       req.request != "HEAD" &amp;&amp;
       req.request != "PUT" &amp;&amp;
       req.request != "POST" &amp;&amp;
       req.request != "TRACE" &amp;&amp;
       req.request != "OPTIONS" &amp;&amp;
       req.request != "DELETE") {
         /* Non-RFC2616 or CONNECT which is weird. */
         return (pipe);
     }
     if (req.request != "GET" &amp;&amp; req.request != "HEAD") {
         /* We only deal with GET and HEAD by default */
         return (pass);
     }
     if (req.http.Authorization || req.http.Cookie) {
         /* Not cacheable by default */
         return (pass);
     }
     return (lookup);

 }
 sub vcl_pipe {
     # Note that only the first request to the backend will have
     # X-Forwarded-For set.  If you use X-Forwarded-For and want to
     # have it set for all requests, make sure to have:
     # set bereq.http.connection = "close";
     # here.  It is not set by default as it might break some broken web
     # applications, like IIS with NTLM authentication.

     set bereq.http.connection = "close";
     return (pipe);
 }
</pre>
<p>
  After that Varnish will shine again.
